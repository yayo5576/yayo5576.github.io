     <p>Ever since I was a child, my love for video games was immeasurable. While I dont know which video game I first played,
     I played over hundreds of them. My best guess at my very first video game would be Call of Duty for the PSP, some game on
     Roblox, or maybe even some Sonic game on a gameboy. I started with the Sony PSP and mobile games, moved to the PS3 and PS4, 
     and started moving to the Nintendo Switch, and eventually the PS5 & PC video games.

     <p>I still remember the times when I would come back from elementary school and watch my uncle play
     Call of Duty: Black Ops 2 for some hours in utter fascination. My brother and most of my uncles 
     played video games alot which probably is the reason why I got hooked on fast. 
     </p>

     <p>I'm not afraid nor ashamed to say that I've spent more than 10,000 hours on video games. Though I'm pretty sure
     the exact number is much higher than my estimate. Some see video games as a waste of time but I see it as a gateway
     for immersive fun and interesting story telling. Those very people who complain its a waste of time probably watch
     TV shows or read books which are not that much different than video games in itself. I for one much rather prefer
     video games over TV since it gives me power and control to make choices in my own story instead of just helplessly 
     watching like a bystander. This is not to rant or berate on how TV or other hobbies are inferior but why I much 
     rather play video games more. 
     </p>

     <p>However, as with all things, we must learn to balance them so I try not to play video games for too much time daily. 
     Still, it doesnt feel right if I don't spent at least some time on a video game even if its on the phone. It just 
     wouldnt make me feel complete for the day. I'm grateful for video games today and in the past since I believe they helped
     me become a better person and for being a source to relieve my stress.
     </p>

     <p>I remember one day, I was playing some COD WW2 game, shooting down enemy Japanese troops deep in wet humid jungles
     with my fellow American soldiers. My mom had walked in and saw all the gritty and gorey killing that I was doing and just
     shook her head in disappointment. She had left and I thought to myself, it wasn't real so why should it matter? I do 
     understand how she must've felt however but there was easily dozens of other bad habits or hobbies that I could of picked up
     at the time. Whenever I play story video games or ones with choices, I strive to do as much good as possible and try to be a hero 
     or the good person. I would feel bad for hurting other characters in the game whether it be emotionally or physically, and try
     to be better later on in the game. That would eventually transfer to real life and make me strive to do more good in this world for 
     our words and actions have meaning that can severly affect others. 
     </p>

     <p>Video games are a portal to many alternate realities.
     I've been a trooper for multiple timelines in multiple wars whether it be in the future, past, or present. I have slained enemies with
     multiple types of blades, swords, daggers, and weaponry. I have ridden horses and dinosaurs and dragons for survival or victory. I have
     gunned down many of the undead with countless bullets. I've experienced death of many friends and allies with tears. I have sought venganence 
     and revenge for many foes and villians. I've casted many magic and spells against enemies like a warlock. I've been a samurai, cowboy, pirate, viking, minuteman,
     assassin, warrior, barbarian, hacker, SWAT member, police, astronaut, and countless amounts of other occupations and jobs. 
     I've died and faced death many, many times. I've tripped, stumbled, staggered, and failed multiple times with near impossible chances of success. 
     Still, I get up and try again and again. Why? Because video games taught me that it was always okay to fall, only and only if I always got back up again afterwards. 
     </p>

     <p>I would be nothing without video games and couldn't imagine my life without it. </p>
