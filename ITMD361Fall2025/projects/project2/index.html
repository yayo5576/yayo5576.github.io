     <h1>Welcome to my Home Page!</h1>
      
     <h2>For my future career, I would want to become a IT Technican.</h2>
  
     <p>
     IT technicians mainly do the responsibilities of installing, fixing, and troubleshooting both software and hardware in a 
     computer system. They mainly provide many services to support, maintain, and repair
     the hardware and software of a company's computer systems.

     <p>According to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, the median annual wage for computer user support specialists in May 2024, was $60,340.
     The employment overall is predicted to decrease by 3 percent from 2024 to 2034. Despite this, around 50,500 openings for 
     the role are expected annually for the next decade. To become a IT Technician or Computer Support Specialist, 
     having relevant IT technican certifcations such as CompTIA A+ and Network+, are more likely to increase the chances of getting employed.  
     </p>

     <p>IT technician always seemed cool and interesting to me since I was always obsessed with computers from a young age. I excelled in computer science
     classes in middle and high school. Helping others is also another reason why the job interests me since I like providing support for others on their issues.
     Aiding others makes me happy even If I didnt fully resolve the issue. For cases that I cannot help, I would ask someone more knowledgable to provide support.
     </p>

     <p>Revelant experience I had are taking computer OS & hardware classes and Linux classes. I have also built my own computer and loaded Linux OSs onto
     laptops several times. I also have experience in using virtual machines primarily VM Ware and Virtual Box. I have set up Ubuntu, Kali, Fedora, and Mint distros. 
     I have also set up older Windows OS versions such as Windows 8.1, XP, and Vista. I have some experience in customer support but none in ticket support systems. 
     </p>

     <p> I would like to land this job in Chicago or somewhere near depending on the pay, location, and various benefits of the company. There are no
     specific companies that I would like to work under but I do think that a school or a office would work fine for me. I have yet to get a internship to get a feel
     for how IT technicans work on a day to day basis.
     </p>

     The U.S. BLS also noted that the states with the highest employment of computer user support specialists, were California, Texas, Florida, New York, and Pennsylvania.
     Metropolitan and nonmetropolitan areas with the highest employment for the job were New York-Newark-Jersey City in New York and New Jersey, Los Angeles-Long Beach-Anaheim in California, 
     Dallas-Fort Worth-Arlington in Texas, Chicago-Naperville-Elgin in Illinois and Indiana, and Washington-Arlington-Alexandria in Washington D.C., Virginia, Maryland, and West Virginia.
