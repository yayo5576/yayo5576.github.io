    <h2>For my future career, I would want to become a IT Technican.</h2>
    <p>IT technicians mainly do the responsibilities of installing, fixing, and troubleshooting both software and hardware in a 
      computer system. They mainly provide many services to support, maintain, and repair
      the hardware and software of a company's computer systems.

    <p>According to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, the median annual wage for computer user support specialists in May 2024, was $60,340.
      The employment overall is predicted to decrease by 3 percent from 2024 to 2034. Despite this, around 50,500 openings for 
      the role are expected annually for the next decade. To become a IT Technician or Computer Support Specialist, 
      relevant IT technican certifcations such as CompTIA A+, and Network+, are more likely to increases chances of getting hired.  
    </p>

    <p>IT technician always seemed cool and interesting to me since I was always obsessed with computers from a young age. I excelled in computer science
      classes in middle and high school. Helping others is also another reason why the job interests me since I like providing support for others on their issues.
      Aiding others makes me happy even If I didnt fully resolve the issue. For cases that I cannot help, I would ask someone more knowledgable to provide support.
    </p>

    <p> Revelant experience I had are taking computer OS & hardware classes and Linux classes. I have also built my own computer and loaded Linux OSs onto
      laptops several times. I also have experience in using virtual machines primarily VM Ware and Virtual Box. I have set up Ubuntu, Kali, Fedora, and Mint distros. 
      I have also set up older Windows OS versions such as Windows 8.1, XP, and Vista. I have some experience in customer support but none in ticket support systems. 
    </p>

    <p> I would like to land this job in Chicago or somewhere near depending on the pay, location, and various benefits of the company. There are no
      specific companies that I would like to work under but I do think that a school or a office would work fine for me. I have yet to get a internship to get a feel
      for how IT technicans work on a day to day basis.
